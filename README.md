# mecanum-cad
Started 2 days ago and didn't realize that all arcade sessions (even if not code) had to be done through commits for it to be counted. Uploading all files as commits based on sessions done (essentially transfering what was typed in the threads to github). Very sorry ^^

cadded a mecanum wheel [based on this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPlvnzvc6x8&ab_channel=CADCAMTUTORIALBYMAHTABALAM) to learn and familiarize myself with solidworks + cad in general; have cadded before, but solidworks is a lot less intuitive than onshape (to me) and i rarely ever cad
